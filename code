/* Write a C++ program that manage the studentâ€™s grades. 
Starting with a fixed number of students (use 10 for simplicity) 
the user will input the grades for each student. 
The number of grades is given by the user. The grades are stored in an array. 
Two functions are called for each student. 
One function will give the numeric average of their grades. 
The other function will give a letter grade to that average. 
Grades are assigned on a 10-point spread.
 90-100 A
 80- 89 B
 70-79 C
 60-69 D
 Below 60 F
